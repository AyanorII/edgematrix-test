## - Approach

This was my first time building a project using the Vue framework. I already have experience with React/Next.js, so it surely helped me to understand the basics since both frameworks use basically the same principles like state and lifecycle. I tried to break the UI into smaller, reusable components and also fetch data from an API (to get the flag of the userâ€™s country) to better understand Vue's lifecycle methods.

## - Improvements

As stated above, this was my first contact with the framework. At the beginning, I felt a little overwhelmed, but my experience with React helped me a lot. Some things that could be improved are the state management and better styling using TailwindCSS, for example, among others.

Some things that, personally, were a challenge to understand are how custom components that use controlled inputs work with v-model.
